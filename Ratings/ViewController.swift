//You can select a scene from the document outline(left of the storyboard) and press delete to get rid of a scene from the storyboard.
//When you delete a scene you also delete its relationship with its parent scene.
//You can drag components from the library onto the storyboard. e.g. a controller to replace the deleted scene.
//Even when you replace a deleted scene, the relatioship remains lost and you need to create a relationship between the newly introduced scene and its parent scene.
//Control + Drag to create relationships betweeen scenes in a storyboard then choose relationship segue - view controllers option from the pop up menu that appears.
